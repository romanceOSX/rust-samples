Pointer types
    --> file:///Users/romance/.rustup/toolchains/stable-aarch64-apple-darwin/share/doc/rust/html/reference/types/pointer.html#shared-references-

Rust has pointer types:
    - references
    - raw pointers
    - smart pointers
        note that these are just custom types, not actual language-integrated pointer types
