Bindings in rust
    When using the let statement we introduce a binding
    Doing a 'let mut' introduces a binding with the following charasteristics:
        - it can be imutably borrowed
        - it can be mutably borrowed

    doing a 'let' alone
        - it can be imutably borrowed

    Both bindings can move the object
