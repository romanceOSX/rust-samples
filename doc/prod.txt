    rustup
        rustup is a toolchain management tool
            a toolchain management tool concerns with the compilation and release

Inner Development Loop
    the time it takes from compiling to running the project
    this considering test-cases and any CI/CD checks

    Linking
            Linking time is a rust problem...
            Linking takes the most time in the compilation process
            'lld', by LLVM is better, we can add it as a cargo flag

    cargo watch
        a nifty tool that builds the project for every file-change
            cargo watch -x check

Continuous Integration
    Testing
        coverage
                It is the percentage that tells you how much code has been tested
                As in, how many subroutines have been 'covered' by the test

            lsp vs linting
                --> https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/1amo8l6/what_is_the_difference_between_lsp_and_linting/
                linting points out idiomatic code, not semantics
                often functionallity overlaps
