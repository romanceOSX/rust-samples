pattern
    It consist of a combination of the following
        - literals
        - destructed arrays, enums, structs, or tuples
        - variables
        - wildcards
        - placeholders

    a pattern describes the shape of data

    to use a pattern we have to compare it to some value
    If the value matches the pattern, we are now able to use the value parts in the code

    refutable vs irrefutable

Where do they appear?
    - matches
        - they have to be exaustive
    - if let
        - a shorter way to write a match that only matches one case

    match vs if let
        In match we can only compare to one value, in the other hand, an iflet can
        compare to anything, even unrelated stuff

    - while let

    - for loops
        the value directly after the 'for' is a pattern
        'for x in y', x is the pattern

    - let statements
        let PATTERN = EXPRESSION;
        
    - function parameters   
        
    in some places the patterns need to be refutable, in other irrefutable
