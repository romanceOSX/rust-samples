cargo is rust's package manager

package
    collection of source files and a Cargo.toml file that describes the package
    A package has a name and version, this is used for identificaton among other packages

    targets
        A package contains targets
        each target is a crate

    The Cargo.toml does the follwoing:
        - describes the type of crate
            - binary
            - library
        - how each of these crates are built
        - direct dependencies

    Package root
        This is where the package's Cargo.toml is located

    Small sized to medium sized rust projects tend to have a single package yet
    multiple cargo files

Cargo Workspaces
    In the case of a project needing multiple packages, a cargo workspace could
    be used

Crate
    It is either a library or an excecutable program
    Every target is for a Cargo package is a 'crate'
    The source code of a crate may be later subdivided into modules

commands
    cargo new <crate name>
        creates a new crate, it defaults to --bin
        use '--lib' to make it a library
        
    cargo build
        it outputs the contents in a build/ directory

    cargo run
        runs it
