unsafe rust

in an unsafe block we can do the following
    - dereference a raw pointer
    - call an unsafe function or method
    - acess or modify a mutable static variable
    - implement an unsafe trait
    - access fields of a union

null pointers
    *const T -> is like int const* in C
    *mut T -> is like int* in C

    - allowed to ignore borrow checker rules
    - aren't guaranteed to point to valid memory
    - can be null
    - don't implement any type of cleanup
