Standard library

Components
    - std::* modules
        - standard modules
        - modules for related constants on primitive types, named the same way as
          those primitive types
    - primitive types
        - These are implicit methods on the primitive types
        - The standard library implements some default methods on them

        - Note that the standard library also has modules named the same way
          as some primitive types, these are helper constants and related constants
    - standard macros
    - rust prelude
